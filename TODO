                         kadmin-remctl To-Do List

 * There is quite a bit of code duplication in kadmin-backend right now
   between the instance commands and the commands for regular principals.
   That script needs another layer of abstraction with generic account
   creation, deletion, and password reset functions.

 * The K4 parts of kadmin-backend should be optional.  Sites other than
   Stanford won't care, but the rest of the code may still be of interest.
