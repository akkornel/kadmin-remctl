                         kadmin-remctl To-Do List

 * There is quite a bit of code duplication in kadmin-backend right now
   between the instance commands and the commands for regular principals.
   That script needs another layer of abstraction with generic account
   creation, deletion, and password reset functions.

 * There should be an easier way of setting defaults for passwd_change
   than patching it at run-time, even though it also supports krb5.conf
   parameters.
