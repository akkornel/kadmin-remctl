                         kadmin-remctl To-Do List

 * There is quite a bit of code duplication in kadmin-backend right now
   between the instance commands and the commands for regular principals.
   That script needs another layer of abstraction with generic account
   creation, deletion, and password reset functions.

 * kadmin-remctl currently supports instance propagation as a special
   case.  Instead, refactor the code so that the same propagation can be
   done for regular accounts with a similar configuration.

 * Rather than make password strength checking a boolean and hard-coding
   the policy name, have the password strength checking option take the
   name of the password policy to use.

 * kadmin-remctl should use Net::LDAP or Net::LDAPapi rather than calling
   the external OpenLDAP utilities.

 * The current kadmin-remctl API is rather lame and is only used for
   historical reasons at Stanford.  Introduce a new, cleaner API with
   better structure to the error reporting and replace the current API
   with that.

 * There should be an easier way of setting defaults for passwd_change
   than patching it at run-time, even though it also supports krb5.conf
   parameters.
