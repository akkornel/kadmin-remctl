kadmin-remctl (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Significant changes to the kadmin-backend configuration.  Many
      global settings are now per-instance, different environments may be
      updated for different instances, and the empty instance is now
      configured just like any other instance.
    - Support updating Active Directory directly without K5.
    - Add a ksetpass client to kadmin-remctl to set passwords via the
      Kerberos password change protocol.
    - Support an account creation workaround for Windows Server 2008 that
      creates an account disabled without a password and then sets the
      password with ksetpass.
    - Support enable and disable for instance management.
    - Handle instance list errors and errors printed in two pieces from
      kadmin correctly.
    - Support include in ACL files.
  * kadmin-remctl is now Architecture: any since it includes ksetpass.
  * No longer include the supervise configuration for the password reset
    remctld instance in the kadmin-remctl package.
  * Move remctl-server and libtext-template-perl to Recommends since
    kadmin-remctl doesn't always need them.
  * Update the long description for kadmin-remctl.  It's no longer very
    Stanford-specific as packaged.
  * Use touch $@ to create stamp files.
  * Update to standards version 3.7.3 (no changes required).
