kadmin-remctl (3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - In the Heimdal version, retry the kadmin connection once if it fails
      and suppress standard error from the Heimdal libraries during the
      connection attempt.
    - Clean up error reporting in the Heimdal version of kadmin-backend.
    - Exit with a non-zero status if check_passwd rejects a password.
    - Produce a better error when attempting to change the password of a
      disabled account in the Heimdal kadmin-backend.
    - Strip whitespace from usernames in passwd_change.
  * Use full path to Stanford's password file in password-change.
  * Switch to xz compression for the upstream and Debian tarballs.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to rebuild the Autotools build system, and link with
    --as-needed to remove the additional unnecessarily library
    dependencies for the client.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V9.
    - Enable parallel builds.
    - Enable build hardening flags.
    - Use DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND to add the Stanford-specific settings
      for the password file path and remctl host for password changes.
  * Update to standards version 3.9.4.
    - Add branch information to the Vcs-Git header.
  * Convert debian/copyright to copyright-format 1.0.

kadmin-remctl (3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix default principal attributes during creation with Heimdal.
    - Don't unconditionally set preauth during creation with Heimdal.
    - Remove boolean checking parameter for MIT.  Instead, add a new
      configuration parameter that sets the password policy to use for
      newly created accounts.
    - Add expiration and pwexpiration commands to set the expiration and
      password expiration of accounts.
    - Add check_expire command which returns the expiration date of an
      account or its password.
    - The MIT backend now supports a create_opts configuration parameter
      that defines additional options to pass to kadmin addprinc.
    - Allow underscores in principal names in examine.
  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format.  Force a single Debian patch and
    include a custom patch header explaining that it is a rollup of any
    fixes cherry-picked from upstream and breaking those patches out
    separately would be work for no gain.
  * Set a Bugs header directing bug reports to me personally.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.0 (no changes required).
