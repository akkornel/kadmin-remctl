=head1 NAME

passwd_change - Change a user's Kerberos password

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<passwd_change> I<user>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<passwd_change> changes the password for I<user>, who may be someone
other than the person running the program.  It may only be run by
authorized users (normally Help Desk personnel); all others will receive
an error message.  The person running the program must have a valid ticket
cache when running it and will be asked to reauthenticate as a security
precaution.  Then, I<user> will be checked against Stanford's user
database and the user's full name will be displayed for verification if
found.  When changing the password for a base-level account, the user will
not be found but one can elect to continue anyway.  Finally, the user is
prompted for the new password (twice).

This program uses the remctl protocol to talk to a central server to do
the password change.
