                    User-Visible kadmin-remctl Changes

kadmin-remctl 1.1 (unreleased)

    Add support for creating and manipulating account instances to
    kadmin-remctl using a separate set of commands.

    Add support in kadmin-remctl for loading configuration from an
    external configuration file, which can override the defaults set at
    the top of the script.

    Add support for reserved principals in kadmin-remctl (principals that
    the script will refuse to act on).

    For password change and reset, always return both an error: and a
    retstr: line to match the behavior of the old Kerberos v4 interface.
    Strip out the kpasswd advice to see its man page, since that text will
    mostly not be useful to our users.

    On password reset, have kadmin-remctl exit with a different exit
    status if the user does not have permission to change passwords for
    that account and use that exit status as a trigger in passwd_change to
    break out of the loop and not keep prompting for a new password.

    Truncate error messages from kpasswd after the first sentence and
    replace newlines with spaces to put them on a single line.  kpasswd is
    more verbose about its errors than kadmin.

kadmin-remctl 1.0 (2007-03-21)

    First public release.  Many defaults are hard-coded into source code
    and synchronization with an AFS kaserver realm is done using
    Stanford-specific external programs.
