                    User-Visible kadmin-remctl Changes

kadmin-remctl 1.1 (unreleased)

    Truncate error messages from kpasswd after the first sentence and
    replace newlines with spaces to put them on a single line.  kpasswd is
    more verbose about its errors than kadmin.

kadmin-remctl 1.0 (2007-03-21)

    First public release.  Many defaults are hard-coded into source code
    and synchronization with an AFS kaserver realm is done using
    Stanford-specific external programs.
